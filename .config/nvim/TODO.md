# To-do
Mappings to start an LSP when it can't find one using the root markers / dir
Better folding visuals
More transparency support of all the things, start with top "what you are inside of thing"
Trouble background not transparent
documentHighlight thing throwing errors in markdown
Looking into LSP handlers
Lualine:
- don't need colour re git modifications
Integrate exrc instead of vimrclocal plugin https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'exrc'
Can we use ftplugin for lsp enablement? e.g. https://dev.to/vonheikemen/a-guide-on-neovims-lsp-client-mn0
