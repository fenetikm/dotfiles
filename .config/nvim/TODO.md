# To-do
- Mappings to start an LSP when it can't find one using the root markers / dir
- Better folding visuals, see: https://github.com/wincent/wincent/blob/main/aspects/nvim/files/.config/nvim/lua/wincent/foldtext.lua
    - with this, remove the phpfolding plugin
- More transparency support of all the things, start with top "what you are inside of thing"
- Trouble background not transparent
- documentHighlight thing throwing errors in markdown
- Looking into LSP handlers
- Lualine:
- - don't need colour re git modifications
- Integrate exrc instead of vimrclocal plugin https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'exrc'
- Can we use ftplugin for lsp enablement? e.g. https://dev.to/vonheikemen/a-guide-on-neovims-lsp-client-mn0

## Folding notes
- https://github.com/fenetikm/phpfolding.vim/blob/master/ftplugin/php/phpfolding.vim
- https://github.com/bbjornstad/pretty-fold.nvim seems unmaintained?
- https://neovim.io/doc/user/fold.html
- Try out the intelephense one and LSP folding
- This one looks interesting, nifty: https://github.com/kevinhwang91/nvim-ufo
